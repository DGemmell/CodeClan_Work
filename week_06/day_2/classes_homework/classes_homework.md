# Homework

Create your own library class with an internal collection of books.

## MVP

* Write a method to count the number of books in the library.
* Write a method to add a book to the library stock.
* Add a capacity to the library and write a method to check if stock is full before adding a book.  

## Extensions:
* Add a third class which interacts with the other two. E.g. you could add a `Borrower` with a method that takes a `Book` and moves to the `Boerrrow`'s collection.
* Add an Enum for the genre of books. (e.g. thriller, crime, etc.) with a string value of a short description of the genre.

## Advanced Extension
* Create a function to go through the books in the library stock and create a HashMap with the key being the Enum property (i.e Genre of book) and value being a count of how many of that Genre.
