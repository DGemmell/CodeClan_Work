# Task: using enumerable methods:
## 1. Find the pet which breed is Husky
## 2. Make an array of all of the pets' names
## 3. Find out if there are any pets of breed 'Dalmation' (true or false)
## 4. Find the most expensive pet i.e. pet with the highest/maximum price
## 5. Find the total value (price) of all of the pets added together.
## 6. Change each pet so their price is 50% cheaper
